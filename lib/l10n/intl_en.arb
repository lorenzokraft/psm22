Information of personal privacy includes health record, tax payment record, social insurance card number, credit card number and other personal secrets.\n\n Circular 25 applies to the collection and use of personal information by websites operated by Vietnamese Government authorities. Circular 25 is not directly applicable to the collection and use of personal information by websites operated by non-Government entities.
